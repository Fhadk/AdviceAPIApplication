# üß™ Java Developer Hiring Task: Advice API Enhancement

Welcome! This task is designed to evaluate your skills in Java Spring Boot development, API design, and secure application architecture. You‚Äôll be working with a basic Advice API application and extending it based on your own technical judgment.

---

## üì¶ Project Overview

The application should include:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization (`ADMIN`, `USER`)
- CRUD operations for an `Advice` entity
- Paginated API responses
- H2 in-memory database
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

---

## üìù Your Task

Your goal is to enhance and evolve the Advice API. You are free to make architectural, design, and implementation decisions as long as they align with best practices.

### Suggested Areas to Explore

You may choose to implement one or more of the following enhancements‚Äîor propose your own:

- **User Registration Flow**  
  Add a secure way for users to register and authenticate.

- **Advice Rating System**  
  Allow users to rate advice entries and retrieve top-rated ones.

- **Advanced Pagination or Filtering**  
  Improve the API‚Äôs usability with flexible query options.

- **Role Management**  
  Introduce role assignment or role-based access control improvements.

- **DTO Mapping and Validation**  
  Use tools like MapStruct or manual mapping to separate concerns.

- **Testing Strategy**  
  Add unit or integration tests to validate core logic.

- **Swagger Improvements**  
  Enhance API documentation with examples and descriptions.

Feel free to go beyond these suggestions if you have ideas that improve the application‚Äôs usability, scalability, or maintainability.

## üöÄ Submission Instructions

- Please make sure to implement your enhancements.
- Update this README.md to explain your changes and decisions.
- Create a branch and make a pull request.

### Implementation Notes

**What was added**
- JWT auth with HS256, BCrypt passwords, stateless security and roles: ADMIN, USER  
- Registration and login endpoints with token issuance  
- Advice CRUD with ownership rules and admin override; soft delete via `isActive`  
- Rating system with unique user rating per advice and computed `averageRating`  
- Advanced pagination and filtering on `/api/advice/search` plus `/api/advice/top-rated`  
- H2 dev DB, role seeding, default admin on boot  
- Global exception handling with a consistent error envelope  
- OpenAPI docs with bearer auth and request/response examples  
- DTOs with Bean Validation and MapStruct mappers  
- Unit, WebMvc, and JPA tests for core scenarios  
- `docs/examples.http` for quick manual testing

**How to run**
- `mvn clean spring-boot:run`  
- Swagger UI: `/swagger-ui.html`  
- H2 console: `/h2-console`  
  - JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:advice-db`  
  - User: `sa`  
  - Password: `(blank)`  
- Default admin: `admin@example.com` / `Admin@1234` (override via env)

**Sample workflow**
1. `POST /api/auth/register` ‚Üí get token  
2. `POST /api/advice` ‚Üí create advice  
3. `POST /api/advice/{id}/rate` ‚Üí rate 1..5  
4. `GET /api/advice/top-rated?page=0&size=10`

**Design decisions**
- Stateless JWT for simplicity; method-level checks for ownership and admin paths  
- Repository filtering using Specifications for extensibility  
- MapStruct keeps controllers thin and mapping consistent

**Limitations and next steps**
- Add refresh tokens with rotation and blacklist  
- Add Postgres profile and Testcontainers for CI parity  
- Add moderation workflow and richer categories
