# 🧪 Java Developer Hiring Task: Advice API Enhancement

Welcome! This task is designed to evaluate your skills in Java Spring Boot development, API design, and secure application architecture. You’ll be working with a basic Advice API application and extending it based on your own technical judgment.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

The application should include:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization (`ADMIN`, `USER`)
- CRUD operations for an `Advice` entity
- Paginated API responses
- H2 in-memory database
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

---

## 📝 Your Task

Your goal is to enhance and evolve the Advice API. You are free to make architectural, design, and implementation decisions as long as they align with best practices.

### Suggested Areas to Explore

You may choose to implement one or more of the following enhancements—or propose your own:

- **User Registration Flow**  
  Add a secure way for users to register and authenticate.

- **Advice Rating System**  
  Allow users to rate advice entries and retrieve top-rated ones.

- **Advanced Pagination or Filtering**  
  Improve the API’s usability with flexible query options.

- **Role Management**  
  Introduce role assignment or role-based access control improvements.

- **DTO Mapping and Validation**  
  Use tools like MapStruct or manual mapping to separate concerns.

- **Testing Strategy**  
  Add unit or integration tests to validate core logic.

- **Swagger Improvements**  
  Enhance API documentation with examples and descriptions.

Feel free to go beyond these suggestions if you have ideas that improve the application’s usability, scalability, or maintainability.
