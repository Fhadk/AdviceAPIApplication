# üß™ Java Developer Hiring Task: Advice API Enhancement

Welcome! This task is designed to evaluate your skills in Java Spring Boot development, API design, and secure application architecture. You‚Äôll be working with a basic Advice API application and extending it based on your own technical judgment.

---

## üì¶ Project Overview

The application should include:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization (`ADMIN`, `USER`)
- CRUD operations for an `Advice` entity
- Paginated API responses
- H2 in-memory database
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

---

## üìù Your Task

Your goal is to enhance and evolve the Advice API. You are free to make architectural, design, and implementation decisions as long as they align with best practices.

### Suggested Areas to Explore

You may choose to implement one or more of the following enhancements‚Äîor propose your own:

- **User Registration Flow**  
  Add a secure way for users to register and authenticate.

- **Advice Rating System**  
  Allow users to rate advice entries and retrieve top-rated ones.

- **Advanced Pagination or Filtering**  
  Improve the API‚Äôs usability with flexible query options.

- **Role Management**  
  Introduce role assignment or role-based access control improvements.

- **DTO Mapping and Validation**  
  Use tools like MapStruct or manual mapping to separate concerns.

- **Testing Strategy**  
  Add unit or integration tests to validate core logic.

- **Swagger Improvements**  
  Enhance API documentation with examples and descriptions.

Feel free to go beyond these suggestions if you have ideas that improve the application‚Äôs usability, scalability, or maintainability.

## üöÄ Submission Instructions

- Please make sure to implement your enhancements.
- Update this README.md to explain your changes and decisions.
- Create a branch and make a pull request.

---

## ‚úÖ Implemented Enhancements

- Authentication & Authorization using JWT with roles `ADMIN` and `USER`
- CRUD endpoints for `Advice` with pagination
- Validation on inputs (`@NotBlank`, max length)
- H2 in-memory DB configured; console enabled
- Swagger/OpenAPI UI available at `/swagger-ui.html`
- User registration and login endpoints
- Method-level security restricting create/update/delete to `ADMIN`
- Unit tests for service layer and controller using MockMvc

## üîê Auth Endpoints

- POST `/api/auth/register` body: `{ "username": "u", "password": "p", "admin": false }`
  - returns `{ token }`
- POST `/api/auth/login` body: `{ "username": "u", "password": "p" }`
  - returns `{ token }`
- Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected routes.

## üí° Advice Endpoints

- GET `/api/advice` with pagination params `page`, `size`, `sort`
- GET `/api/advice/{id}`
- POST `/api/advice` (ADMIN)
- PUT `/api/advice/{id}` (ADMIN)
- DELETE `/api/advice/{id}` (ADMIN)

## üß∞ Run & Test

```bash
mvn clean test
mvn spring-boot:run
```

H2 Console: `/h2-console` (JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:advice-db`, user `sa`, blank password)

Swagger UI: `/swagger-ui.html`

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for `AdviceService` CRUD
- Slice tests for `AdviceController` using MockMvc + JWT
- Minimal auth flow smoke test

## üß≠ Notes on Design Decisions

- Stateless JWT auth with a short-lived token (1h)
- Roles prefixed with `ROLE_` for Spring Security
- Validation annotations to keep entity constraints simple
